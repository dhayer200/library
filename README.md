## Who Am I?

I’m Deep Hayer, 15 years old, from Austin, Texas. I’ve been in college since I was 12. My focus is quantitative finance, systems trading, and self-mastery.

This repo is a record of rigor, reflection, and execution. It’s not just a roadmap into quanthood. It’s how I study math, code, finance, and myself.

The best thinkers didn’t just learn — they wrote, reflected, revised. This is how I build systems. This is how I build myself.

## Structure

Nothing here is static. Code, notes, and structure will evolve.

### 🧾 `/library/`

This is my Zettelkasten system:
- **Fleeting Notes**: raw ideas, unfiltered thoughts
- **Literature Notes**: knowledge pulled from books, lectures, papers
- **Permanent Notes**: linked concepts, derivations, essays — inspired by Montaigne

### 🧠 `/code/`

Same structure, in code:
- **`/fleeting/`**: scratch scripts, math jots, problem solvers
- **`/literature/`**: code based on books, tutorials, reference materials
- **`/permanent/`**: full projects, simulation engines, quant toolkits

Topics include:
- Calculus, linear algebra, probability, statistics
- Real analysis, ODEs, stochastic calculus
- Monte Carlo methods, portfolio optimization, risk modeling
- Strategy engines, systematic trading, data pipelines

## Why?

Mastery means solving problems while understanding yourself. This is a place to write, build, and think in public. No wasted thoughts.

## Goal

The goal is to set a standard. To show that even one person, documenting clearly and building deliberately, can go deep. If you’re learning, moving, building — document it. Own it.

This is my work. This is my quant.
